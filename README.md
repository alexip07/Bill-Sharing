Hi!
This is a small project that i made. It calculates the value one should pay based on how long it stayed in the house. 
It has 3 classes, one for creating a PDF-Report(report file), and 2 for the flatmate-object and the bill calculator (flat file).
I hope it`s a fun project for you too.
Have a greate day.
